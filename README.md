Remote Execution Might Offer True Excitement


This code was pulled out of one of the TINNSnips projects.  
It is a web server, which is meant to be attached to a framebuffer/app 
so that drawing can be viewed from a remote client.

In this case, sharer.lua is the primary driver of the application.
